# 3. Detailed Feature Manual

This chapter provides detailed usage instructions for the main features of the Open DID Verifier Admin Console.

## 3.1. Verifier Management

Verifier Management is a core function responsible for registering and managing Verifier servers in the OpenDID system.

The Verifier is the entity that verifies VP (Verifiable Presentation) and ZKP Proof submitted by users, and is an important component that forms the foundation of all verification policies. Verifier registration is performed **only once** during initial system setup, and afterwards, you can view and manage the registered information.

### 3.1.1. Verifier Registration Process

Verifier registration is a step-by-step procedure to safely participate new verifiers in the OpenDID ecosystem. It proceeds through a total of **3 sequential steps**.

#### **Overall Registration Flow**
```
Step 1: Enter Verifier basic information and connection test
     ‚Üì
Step 2: Generate DID Document and request TA registration
     ‚Üì (2-1: Generate ‚Üí 2-2: Request ‚Üí 2-3: Check approval)
     ‚Üì
Step 3: Entity registration and membership certificate issuance
     ‚Üì
Registration Complete: Move to Verifier Management menu
```

---

#### **Step 1 - Enter Verifier Basic Information**

In the first step, enter the basic information of the Verifier server and check actual connectivity.

<img src="./images/verifier-registration.png" width="600"/>

| Input Item | Description | Input Example | Required |
|------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Name** | Enter the unique name of the Verifier server. | `MyCompany-Verifier` | ‚úÖ Required |
| **Verifier URL** | Enter the access URL of the Verifier server. | `http://192.168.1.100:8094/verifier` | ‚úÖ Required |

##### **Connection Test Function**
- Click the **Test Connection** button to check if actual connection is possible with the entered URL.
- The **NEXT** button is activated to proceed to the next step only when connection is successful.
- If connection fails, recheck the URL and verify that the Verifier server is running properly.

> **Note**: The Verifier URL format must be in the form `http://<IP or domain>:<port>/verifier`.

---

#### **Step 2 - DID Document Registration**

The second step is the process of registering the Verifier's identity on the blockchain, consisting of **3 detailed steps**.

> **Important**: Once created, DID Documents **cannot be modified or re-registered**. Please proceed carefully.

##### **Step 2-1: DID Document Generation**

Automatically generates a unique DID Document for the Verifier server.

<img src="./images/register-did-document-step2.png" width="600"/>

| Button | Function | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **GENERATE** | Automatically generate Verifier DID Document | Generate JSON document including DID, public key, and service endpoint |

- Upon successful generation, a green message appears and the Step 2-2 area is automatically displayed.
- The generated DID Document includes the following information:
  - **DID**: Distributed identity identifier in the form `did:omn:verifier:<unique identifier>`
  - **Public Key**: Cryptographic key information for verification
  - **Service Endpoint**: Access point information for the Verifier server

##### **Step 2-2: TA Admin Registration Request**

Request registration of the generated DID Document to the Trust Authority (TA).

<img src="./images/register-did-document-step2-1.png" width="600"/>

| Button | Function | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **REQUEST** | Send DID registration request to TA Admin | Create a request that requires manual approval from TA administrator |

- Upon successful request, a green message appears and the Step 2-3 area is automatically displayed.
- After this step, you need to wait for approval from the TA administrator.

##### **Step 2-3: Check Approval Status**

Check whether the TA administrator has approved the DID Document registration request.

<img src="./images/check-approval.png" width="600"/>

| Button | Function | Result by Status |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **CHECK** | Query TA approval status | **Approved**: Green message + NEXT button activated<br>**Rejected**: Red message + reason displayed |

> **TA Administrator approval process** is an essential process for the security of the OpenDID ecosystem. Please check the status regularly until approval is complete.

---

#### **Step 3 - Entity Registration and Membership Certificate Issuance**

In the final step, register the Verifier as an official member (Entity) of the OpenDID ecosystem and receive a membership certificate.

<img src="./images/verifier-regstration-step3.png" width="600"/>

This step automatically executes **TA Protocol P132 (User Registration Protocol)** to perform the following processes:

1. **Entity Registration Request**: Register Verifier as Entity on TA server
2. **Certificate Issuance**: Generate and receive membership certificate (Certificate VC)
3. **Wallet Key Management**: Securely store Verifier's private/public key pair

| Button | Function | Processing Content |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **REQUEST** | Execute Entity registration protocol | Automatically execute TA Protocol P132 |
| **FINISH** | Complete registration and move to main screen | Switch to Verifier Management screen |

> The membership certificate (Certificate VC) is a digital certificate that proves the Verifier is a trustworthy verifier. It is used to prove the Verifier's identity in all subsequent verification processes.
